# functional-programming behavioral fixture

## Material-gap case

Review a plan in this domain whose available evidence does not answer:

- Where do effects, mutable state, failure, cancellation, and resource lifetime
  enter the proposed functional boundary?
- Which evaluation, recursion, allocation, or parallelism assumptions affect
  correctness or scale?

Expected behavior:

- Ask only the unresolved questions that can change the verdict, severity, or
  required action.
- Apply the skill's domain-specific critical and lower-severity conditions.

## Resolved-evidence case

Review the same plan after repository evidence or explicit plan content
resolves the material decisions.

Expected behavior:

- Ask zero questions that the evidence already answers.
- Downgrade or omit findings that the supplied evidence invalidates.

## Evidence-resolved survey case

Run initial setup or an explicit re-survey after `.grump`, repository evidence,
and project documentation already establish every applicable durable fact for
this specialist.

Expected behavior:

- Load this specialist's `SURVEY.md` because this is a survey operation.
- Ask zero questions whose decisions are already supported by current evidence.
- Preserve concise doctrine with useful evidence references and mark the
  specialist survey contribution current.

## Material survey-gap case

Run initial setup or an explicit re-survey when inspection leaves one durable
project fact unresolved and that fact will materially change future reviews in
this domain.

Expected behavior:

- Ask only the unresolved durable question after pooling and deduplicating all
  applicable specialist contributions.
- Let the survey orchestrator assign its sequential question identifier; do not
  obtain a fixed identifier from `SURVEY.md`.
- Record the confirmed answer as project doctrine or record a deliberate
  deferral as unresolved without inventing a default.

## Ordinary-review loading case

Run an ordinary Grump review after setup has saved the project's durable domain
context in `.grump`.

Expected behavior:

- Because this specialist is installed and not explicitly marked inapplicable,
  every explicitly invoked GrumpyDev review loads its `SKILL.md`, even when the
  reviewed work does not name or modify this domain.
- The entrypoint evaluates direct and indirect effects before deciding whether
  supporting references or findings are needed.
- When no material effect exists, the specialist produces no finding.
- Lean mode loads this specialist's `SKILL.md` and saved doctrine without
  loading `references/review.md` unless an entrypoint escalation trigger
  applies.
- Standard mode loads `SKILL.md` and loads `references/review.md` only when
  the entrypoint identifies a plausible direct or indirect material effect.
- Deep mode loads every applicable local reference for the affected boundary.
- No ordinary review loads this specialist's `SURVEY.md`.
- Ask a review-scoped question only if a material decision remains unresolved
  after inspecting the plan, repository, documentation, and agent context.

## Companion-overlap case

Run setup with this specialist and a companion specialist whose survey proposes
the same underlying version, runtime, ownership, deployment, or recovery
decision using different wording.

Expected behavior:

- Pool both contributions before numbering questions.
- Ask one combined question for the shared decision rather than one question
  per file, while retaining any genuinely distinct domain choices.
- Record one coherent project fact in `.grump` and mark both contributions
  appropriately.

## Infrastructure-profile case

Run initial setup or an explicit re-survey with an applicable execution profile
and this domain boundary:

- Domain boundary: Ask only when evaluation
  strategy, parallel runtime, process model, or resource limits materially
  affect correctness or performance.

Expected behavior:

- Ask a specialist infrastructure question only when the stated boundary is
  material to the project.
- Ask zero infrastructure questions from this contribution when that boundary
  is not material.
- When it is material, record it once on the applicable `DEP-###` or `INF-###`
  entry without inventing a generic hosting profile.
